What is Rape?\\n\\n\r\nTypically, rape is an expression of aggression, anger, or need for power; psychologically, it is more violent than sexual. Non genital or genital injury occurs in about 50% of rapes of females.\r\n\\n\\nQ2. What is the difference between Sexual Assualt/ Harassment and Rape?\\n\r\nSexual Assault- Sexual Assault refers to sexual contact or a behaviour that occurs without consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include:\r\nAttempted rape\r\nGroping or unwanted sexual touching\r\nForcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body.\r\n\r\nSexual Harassment:\r\n\r\nRape: Rape is a form of sexual assault, but not all sexual assault is rape. The term rape is often used as a legal definition to specifically include sexual penetration without consent.\r\n\r\n\\n\\nQ3. What are different types of Rape?\r\nFollowing are different types of Rape:\r\nMinor Rapes\\n\r\nGang Rapes\\n\r\nMarital Rapes\\n\r\nIncest\\n\r\nRevenge Rape\\n\r\nCustodial Rape\\n\r\nRape under the false pretext of marriage\\n\\n\r\n\r\nMinor or statutory rape\r\nStatutory rape is a crime that involves sexual contact with a person who is under an age specified by law, commonly referred to as the “age of consent.” Most states no longer refer to this crime as statutory rape. The legal term for the crime varies from state to state and includes sexual intercourse with a minor, sexual assault of a child, criminal sexual penetration of a minor or a child under a certain age, and sexual abuse of a minor. Statutory rape is based on the notion that a person under a certain age cannot consent to sexual contact or activity because he or she lacks the maturity or judgement necessary to make a knowing choice about sexual activity. Even when no force is involved and the sex appears consensual, the act of having sex with a person under the age of consent is a crime solely because of that person’s age. (Crimiminal Defence Lawyer , 2018 )\r\nGang Rapes- IPC 376 D defines gang rape as “Where a woman is raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to committed the offence of rape” Gang Rapes are the rapes that involves a group of men, this act is pre- meditated and pre-empted. When a group of men have sexual intercourse that is non-consensual (not agreed upon), or they force another person to have sex against her will.\r\nMarital Rapes- Intimate partner rape. A rape that is non- consensual, (not agreed upon), or if a husband or a partner (living in Domestic Relationship) forces wife or the other partner to have sex against her will it is termed as marital rape.  Rape includes intercourse in the vagina, anus, or mouth. It is unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person\\'s will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception. Marital rape is a non- criminalised crime in India. India is one of the thirty-six countries that still have not criminalized marital rape.\r\nIncest- Incest is sexual intercourse between closely related persons. The crime of sexual intercourse, cohabitation, or marriage between persons within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity wherein marriage is legally forbidden. The prevalence of incest cases is reported to vary between 5% and 62% according to culture, the source of the report, and geographic location.\r\nRevenge Rape- Payback rape\", also called \"revenge rape\", is a form of rape specific to certain culture. It consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers. The rape is meant to humiliate and bring shame upon the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behaviour towards the perpetrators.  Payback rape is sometimes connected to tribal fighting.\r\nCustodial Rape- Custodial rape is one of the most heinous and serious crimes against women and one of the categories of rape which involves the abuse of power and authority, by people responsible to protect and promote the rights of women. At present, the greatest threats faced by women are from those who are supposed to protect them. Police and custodial rape are the most prevalent forms of aggravated rape in India. Custodial rapes are heinous crimes as they reflect betrayal of custodial trust by a public servant against the helpless citizen.\r\nRape under false pretext of Marriage- Hindu marriage joins two individuals for life, so that they can pursue dharma (duty), artha (possessions), and kama (physical desires). It is a union of two individuals as husband and wife, and is recognized by law. In Hinduism, marriage is followed by traditional rituals for consummation.\r\n\r\nThe consent for sexual intercourse obtained by a person by giving false promise of marriage would not excuse him from rape charges. Whenever the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact as per Section 90 of the Indian Panel Code, and, in such a case, such a consent would not excuse the offender and such an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of the Indian Panel Code, and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.\r\nSection 375 and Section 90 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and on the consent/consensual sex are required to be referred to and considered.\r\nLaws pertaining to sexual assault/ harassment and rape in India\r\nPOCSO- The POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive law to provide for the protection of children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, while safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated Special Courts. The said Act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age, and defines different forms of sexual abuse, including penetrative and non-penetrative assault, as well as sexual harassment and pornography, and deems a sexual assault to be “aggravated” under certain circumstances, such as when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-à-vis the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor. People who trafficking children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the provisions relating to abetment in the said Act. The said Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life, and fine.\r\nSexual Harassment at Work Place- Sexual harassment at a workplace is considered violation of women's right to equality, life and liberty. It creates an insecure and hostile work environment, which discourage women's participation in work, thereby adversely affecting their social and economic empowerment and the goal of inclusive growth1. With this idea the legislature formulated the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.\r\n    </string>\r\n<string name=\"safesex\">\r\nQ1.

What is HIV and AIDS?\r\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.\r\nAIDS- is a set of symptoms (or syndrome) caused by the HIV virus. A person is said to have AIDS when their immune system is too weak to fight off infection, and they develop certain symptoms and illnesses (known as ‘opportunistic infections’). This is the last stage of HIV, when the infection is very advanced, and if left untreated will lead to death.[ Avert- Global information and Education on HIV and AIDS.\r\nhttps://www.avert.org/about-hiv-aids/what-hiv-aids?gclid=Cj0KCQiA0-6ABhDMARIsAFVdQv_mZtjw8TwOZ0k_oVTqcBT_oYVjw9LExo9Oocl2ltwKvoGzS9IRlz8aAqjFEALw_wcB\r\n\r\n]\r\nHomosexuals have also faced the impact of the AIDS since it’s advent in 1990s. It could spread through heterosexual partners as well.\r\nWhat causes HIV?\\n\r\nHIV is spread through\\n\r\n1)Via unprotected sex \\n\r\n2)Through blood transfusion of an infected person \\n\r\n3)Breast feeding by an HIV infected mother\\n\r\nTest: \\n\r\nThere is an HIV test.

What precautions are to be taken during oral sex?\\n\r\nPrecautions like:\\n\r\nUse of Condos or dental dams while performing sex \\n\r\nAvoid having sex if there is a cut or sore on the private parts. \\n\r\nHistory of Safe sex practice\\n\r\nThe history of safe sex can be understood in terms of two periods. Prior to the late 1970s, the term and its associated practices were vaguely defined. By the late 1980s, a robust, consistent (if still heterogeneous) set of creeds and practices had emerged. This section examines those two periods and the transition between them.\r\n\\nSexually Transmitted Diseases- Diseases that are spread through the act of unprotected sex.\r\n1)Chlamydia: \\n\r\nIt affects both men and women, if a woman is infected with this virus then it is rather serious for her as it may lead to infertility, or difficulty in conceiving a baby. This virus can further lead to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. It spreads through an infected person, 70- 80% people do not show any symptoms.\r\nSymptoms in men\\n\r\n1)Urination at regular interval with burning sensation\\n\r\n2)A thin cloudy discharge oozing out of penis\\n\r\n3)Slightly swollen testicles\\n\r\nSymptoms in women\\n\r\nA.Heavy discharge from Vagina.\\n\r\nB.In between periods or sex women may bleed if infected.\\n\r\nConsult a doctor if you see any symptoms.\\n\r\nEven though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition.\\n\r\n2)Genital Warts \\n\r\nIt is caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), they are mainly concentrated in the pubic area, particularly the vagina, cervix, penis, anus and rectum. HPV infection occurs when the virus enters your body, usually through a cut, abrasion or small tear in your skin. The virus is transferred primarily by skin-to-skin contact. Genital HPV infections are contracted through sexual intercourse, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital region. Some HPV infections that result in oral or upper respiratory lesions are contracted through oral sex. If you are pregnant and have an HPV infection with genital warts, it\\'s possible your baby may get the infection. Rarely, the infection may cause a noncancerous growth in the baby\\'s voice box (larynx).\r\nWarts are contagious. They can spread through direct contact with a wart. Warts can also spread when someone touches something that already touched a wart.[ HPV infection by Mayo Clinic\r\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596\r\n]\r\nEven though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition.\r\n\r\n3)Gonorrhoea: \\n\r\nIt is an infection that mainly grows in moist and warm areas such as vagina, cervix, urethra, rectum and throat. It spreads through unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex, it can also spread through using and sharing sex toys if they are un washed after the use.\r\nSymptoms:\\n\r\nIn women:\\n\r\n1)More than usual vaginal discharge of greenish yellow tinge\\n\r\n2)Pain during urination \\n\r\n3)Infection in rectum and in eyes \\n\r\n4)A throat infection \\n\r\n5)Heavier periods with lower abdominal pains and tenderness alongside bleeding between the 2 periods\\n\r\nIn Men: \\n\r\n1.The symptoms in men are similar to that of women except \\n\r\n2.Testicle pain and tenderness \\n\r\nHow to get rid of Gonorrhoea\\n\r\nBefore treatments tests are recommended.\\n\r\nIt is a good practice to always use protection (Condom)\r\nEven though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition.\r\nRisk Factors\\n\r\nNumber of sexual partners. The more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract a genital HPV infection. Having sex with a partner who has had multiple sex partners also increases your risk.\r\nAge. Common warts occur mostly in children. Genital warts occur most often in adolescents and young adults.\r\nWeakened immune systems. People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections. Immune systems can be weakened by HIV/AIDS or by immune system-suppressing drugs used after organ transplants.\r\nComplications\\n:\r\nOral and upper respiratory lesions. Some HPV infections cause lesions on your tongue, tonsils, soft palate, or within your larynx and nose.\r\nCancer. Certain strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer. These strains might also contribute to cancers of the genitals, anus, mouth and upper respiratory tract. (Mayo Clinic, 2019)\r\nA regular Pap Amer Test enables in detecting the virus.\r\n\\nIt is best advised that you consult a doctor in every step of the way.\r\n4)Hepatitis B\\n\r\nHepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids, including sex with an infected partner, injection-drug use that involves sharing needles, syringes, or drug-preparation equipment and needle sticks or exposures to sharp instruments. WHO estimates that in 2015, 257 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positive)? In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 887 000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (i.e., primary liver cancer). (World Health Organization , 2020)\r\nSymptoms\\n\r\nMost people do not experience any symptoms when newly infected. However, some people have acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. A small subset of persons with acute hepatitis can develop acute liver failure, which can lead to death. In some people, the hepatitis B virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.[ Hepatitis B, by WHO\r\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b\r\n]\r\nTreatment:\\n\r\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as three or four injections over six months. You can't get hepatitis B from the vaccine.\r\nTake precautions to avoid HBV\r\nOther ways to reduce your risk of HBV include:\r\nKnow the HBV status of any sexual partner. Don't engage in unprotected sex unless you're absolutely certain your partner isn't infected with HBV or any other sexually transmitted infection.\r\nUse a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex if you don't know the health status of your partner. Remember that although condoms can reduce your risk of contracting HBV, they don't eliminate the risk.\r\nDon't use illegal drugs. If you use illicit drugs, get help to stop. If you can't stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs. Never share needles.\r\nBe cautious about body piercing and tattooing. If you get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop. Ask about how the equipment is cleaned. Make sure the employees use sterile needles. If you can't get answers, look for another shop.[ Mayo clinic- Hepatitis B\r\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802\r\n]\\n\r\nEven though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition.\r\n5)Herpes:\\n\r\nHerpes results from infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It causes sores or blisters to form in or around the mouth or genitals. There are two types of HSV:\r\nHSV-1 causes oral herpes, which usually affects the mouth and surrounding skin.\r\nHSV-2 causes genital herpes, which is usually sexually transmitted.[ Medical News Today\r\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151739#_noHeaderPrefixedContent\r\n]\r\nHSV is a common virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 67% of people, globally, have an HSV-1 infection, and 11% have an HSV-2 infection. .[ Medical News Today\r\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151739#_noHeaderPrefixedContent\r\n]\r\nSymptoms:\\n\r\nOral Herpes: \\n\r\n\uF0B7It causes blisters, sores that develop in and around mouth and lips \\n\r\n\uF0B7These sores/ blisters lasts 2-3 weeks \\n\r\nGenital Herpes: \\n\r\n\uF0B7The sores that tend to develop on penis, in or around Vagina or anus \\n\r\n\uF0B7Pain while urination, and change in the vaginal discharge. \\n\r\n\uF0B7Sores/ blisters lasts for 2- 6 weeks \\n\r\n\uF0B7Swollen lymph nodes \\n\r\n\uF0B7Fever, fatigue and a feeling of being un well.\\n\r\nTreatment \\n\r\nNo medication/ drug can eliminate the herpes virus, but antivirals and itch creams can help. \\n\r\nEven though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition. \\n\r\n6)Syphilis: \\n\r\nSyphilis is a bacterial infection usually spread by sexual contact. The disease starts as a painless sore typically on your genitals, rectum or mouth. Syphilis spreads from person to person via skin or mucous membrane contact with these sores. After the initial infection, the syphilis bacteria can remain inactive (dormant) in your body for decades before becoming active again. Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot (injection) of penicillin. Without treatment, syphilis can severely damage your heart, brain or other organs, and can be life-threatening. Syphilis can also be passed from mothers to unborn children.[ Mayo Clinic- Syphilis\r\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/syphilis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351756\r\n]\\n\r\nSymptoms \\n\r\nSyphilis develops in stages, and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap, and symptoms don't always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis and not notice any symptoms for years.\r\nThe Infection spreads in 3 stages\\n\r\nStage 1: Sores on vagina, penis, mouth or anus \\n\r\nStage 2: rashes within two- six months of infection, along with flu like symptoms \\n\r\nStage 3: Vital organs of the body like heart and brain are damaged permanently \\n\r\nVisit your doctor if you experience, unusual discharge, sore or rash especially in vagina or penis.\\n\r\nRisk factors: \\n\r\nYou face an increased risk of acquiring syphilis if you:\\n\r\n\uF0B7Engage in unprotected sex\\n\r\n\uF0B7Have sex with multiple partners\\n\r\n\uF0B7Are a man who has sex with men\\n\r\n\uF0B7Are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS\\n\r\nBest way to prevent syphilis by using protection\\n\r\nIt is best advised that you consult a doctor in every step of the way.\\n\r\n7)Thrush \\n\r\nIt is a condition that is caused by a yeast which lives on human skin, when this yeast grows out of proportion it becomes a thrush infection. \\n\r\nSymptoms of Thrush: There are visible signs and symptoms for both men and women. \\n\r\nThrush Infection in Women: \\n\r\n1)It is a thick vaginal discharge that looks like cottage cheese with a foul odour \\n\r\n2)Itching or redness around vagina and anus \\n\r\n3)Pain during sex or urination. \\n\r\nThrush infection in Men: \\n\r\n1)Burning sensation or an itch under the foreskin or the penis tip \\n\r\n2)Red patches on the penis tip or the under foreskin. \\n\r\n3)Discomfort while trying to pull the foreskin back, thick cheese like disposition under foreskin and \\n\r\n4)Pain and discomfort during urinating \\n\r\nHow to get rid of Thrush\\n\r\nThe treatment is easy and simple, for both men and women it is prescribed to apply a cream in the infected areas. For women it is also suggested one can use pessaries (a tablet to insert in vagina like tampons) *\r\nDo’s and Don’ts s to be followed while experiencing thrush:\r\nDon’ts \\n\r\n- Don’t wear tight pants, lycra pants or denim jeans \\n\r\n- Don’t use perfumed soaps, genital washes etc.\\n\r\n- Don’t consume any anti- biotics till the infection clears \\n\r\nDo’s \\n\r\n- Use cotton underpants\\n\r\n-Use condoms to avoid infecting the partner.\\n\r\nEven though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition. \\n\r\n8)Trichomoniasis: \\n\r\nTrichomoniasis is perhaps a common sexually transmitted infection, caused by parasite. In women trichomoniasis can be identified by foul- smelling vaginal discharge, genital itching, and pain while urination. Pregnant women, with trichomoniasis have a risk of delivering premature babies. Men typically have no symptoms.\r\nSymptoms in women: \\n\r\n\uF0B7A foul-smelling vaginal discharge — which might be white, grey, yellow or green\\n\r\n\uF0B7Genital redness, burning and

-    <string name="rape">
-        Q1. What is Rape?\n\n
-Typically, rape is an expression of aggression, anger, or need for power; psychologically, it is more violent than sexual. Non genital or genital injury occurs in about 50% of rapes of females.
-\n\nQ2. What is the difference between Sexual Assualt/ Harassment and Rape?\n
-Sexual Assault- Sexual Assault refers to sexual contact or a behaviour that occurs without consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include:
-Attempted rape
-Groping or unwanted sexual touching
-Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body.
-
-Sexual Harassment:
+<string name="rape">
+    Rape is defined in most jurisdictions as sexual intercourse, or other forms of sexual penetration, committed by a perpetrator against a victim without their consent.[17] The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement, health providers, and legal professions.[18] It has varied historically and culturally.[17][18] Originally, rape had no sexual connotation and is still used in other contexts in English. In Roman law, it or raptus was classified as a form of crimen vis, "crime of assault".[19][20] Raptus referred to the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time.
 
-Rape: Rape is a form of sexual assault, but not all sexual assault is rape. The term rape is often used as a legal definition to specifically include sexual penetration without consent.
+Until 2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed their definition from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent. The definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.[21][22]
 
-\n\nQ3. What are different types of Rape?
-Following are different types of Rape:
-Minor Rapes\n
-Gang Rapes\n
-Marital Rapes\n
-Incest\n
-Revenge Rape\n
-Custodial Rape\n
-Rape under the false pretext of marriage\n\n
-
-Minor or statutory rape
-Statutory rape is a crime that involves sexual contact with a person who is under an age specified by law, commonly referred to as the “age of consent.” Most states no longer refer to this crime as statutory rape. The legal term for the crime varies from state to state and includes sexual intercourse with a minor, sexual assault of a child, criminal sexual penetration of a minor or a child under a certain age, and sexual abuse of a minor. Statutory rape is based on the notion that a person under a certain age cannot consent to sexual contact or activity because he or she lacks the maturity or judgement necessary to make a knowing choice about sexual activity. Even when no force is involved and the sex appears consensual, the act of having sex with a person under the age of consent is a crime solely because of that person’s age. (Crimiminal Defence Lawyer , 2018 )
-Gang Rapes- IPC 376 D defines gang rape as “Where a woman is raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to committed the offence of rape” Gang Rapes are the rapes that involves a group of men, this act is pre- meditated and pre-empted. When a group of men have sexual intercourse that is non-consensual (not agreed upon), or they force another person to have sex against her will.
-Marital Rapes- Intimate partner rape. A rape that is non- consensual, (not agreed upon), or if a husband or a partner (living in Domestic Relationship) forces wife or the other partner to have sex against her will it is termed as marital rape.  Rape includes intercourse in the vagina, anus, or mouth. It is unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person\'s will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception. Marital rape is a non- criminalised crime in India. India is one of the thirty-six countries that still have not criminalized marital rape.
-Incest- Incest is sexual intercourse between closely related persons. The crime of sexual intercourse, cohabitation, or marriage between persons within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity wherein marriage is legally forbidden. The prevalence of incest cases is reported to vary between 5% and 62% according to culture, the source of the report, and geographic location.
-Revenge Rape- Payback rape", also called "revenge rape", is a form of rape specific to certain culture. It consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers. The rape is meant to humiliate and bring shame upon the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behaviour towards the perpetrators.  Payback rape is sometimes connected to tribal fighting.
-Custodial Rape- Custodial rape is one of the most heinous and serious crimes against women and one of the categories of rape which involves the abuse of power and authority, by people responsible to protect and promote the rights of women. At present, the greatest threats faced by women are from those who are supposed to protect them. Police and custodial rape are the most prevalent forms of aggravated rape in India. Custodial rapes are heinous crimes as they reflect betrayal of custodial trust by a public servant against the helpless citizen.
-Rape under false pretext of Marriage- Hindu marriage joins two individuals for life, so that they can pursue dharma (duty), artha (possessions), and kama (physical desires). It is a union of two individuals as husband and wife, and is recognized by law. In Hinduism, marriage is followed by traditional rituals for consummation.
-
-The consent for sexual intercourse obtained by a person by giving false promise of marriage would not excuse him from rape charges. Whenever the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact as per Section 90 of the Indian Panel Code, and, in such a case, such a consent would not excuse the offender and such an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of the Indian Panel Code, and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.
-Section 375 and Section 90 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and on the consent/consensual sex are required to be referred to and considered.
-Laws pertaining to sexual assault/ harassment and rape in India
-POCSO- The POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive law to provide for the protection of children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, while safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated Special Courts. The said Act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age, and defines different forms of sexual abuse, including penetrative and non-penetrative assault, as well as sexual harassment and pornography, and deems a sexual assault to be “aggravated” under certain circumstances, such as when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-à-vis the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor. People who trafficking children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the provisions relating to abetment in the said Act. The said Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life, and fine.
-Sexual Harassment at Work Place- Sexual harassment at a workplace is considered violation of women's right to equality, life and liberty. It creates an insecure and hostile work environment, which discourage women's participation in work, thereby adversely affecting their social and economic empowerment and the goal of inclusive growth1. With this idea the legislature formulated the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.
-    </string>
+Health organizations and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines rape as a form of sexual assault,[23] while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of sexual violence. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity that may or may not include rape, including drug-facilitated sexual assault, acts in which a victim is made to penetrate a perpetrator or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration of a victim via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon).[24][25] The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has implemented universal screening for what has been termed "military sexual trauma" (MST) and provides medical and mental health services free of charge to enrolled veterans who report MST (Title 38 United States Code 1720D; Public Law 108-422).

It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.
-AIDS- is a set of symptoms (or syndrome) caused by the HIV virus. A person is said to have AIDS when their immune system is too weak to fight off infection, and they develop certain symptoms and illnesses (known as ‘opportunistic infections’). This is the last stage of HIV, when the infection is very advanced, and if left untreated will lead to death.[ Avert- Global information and Education on HIV and AIDS.
-https://www.avert.org/about-hiv-aids/what-hiv-aids?gclid=Cj0KCQiA0-6ABhDMARIsAFVdQv_mZtjw8TwOZ0k_oVTqcBT_oYVjw9LExo9Oocl2ltwKvoGzS9IRlz8aAqjFEALw_wcB
+STDs are infections that are passed from one person to another during sexual activity. Anybody who has oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex, genital skin-to-skin contact, or who shares sexual fluids with another person can get STDs. Safer sex (often called “safe sex”) means taking steps to protect yourself and your partner from STDs when you have sex.

+There are lots of ways you can make sex safer. One of the best ways is by using a barrier — like condoms, internal condoms, dental dams, and/or latex or nitrile gloves — every single time you have oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or do anything that can pass sexual fluids (like sharing sex toys). Barriers protect you and your partner from sexual fluids and some skin-to-skin contact, which can both spread STDs.

HPV infection occurs when the virus enters your body, usually through a cut, abrasion or small tear in your skin. The virus is transferred primarily by skin-to-skin contact. Genital HPV infections are contracted through sexual intercourse, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital region. Some HPV infections that result in oral or upper respiratory lesions are contracted through oral sex. If you are pregnant and have an HPV infection with genital warts, it\'s possible your baby may get the infection. Rarely, the infection may cause a noncancerous growth in the baby\'s voice box (larynx).
-Warts are contagious. They can spread through direct contact with a wart. Warts can also spread when someone touches something that already touched a wart.[ HPV infection by Mayo Clinic

+Getting tested for STDs regularly is also part of safer sex, even if you always use barriers like condoms and feel totally fine. Most people with STDs don’t have symptoms or know they’re infected, and they can easily pass the infection to their partners. So testing is the only way to know for sure whether or not someone has an STD.
 
-3)Gonorrhoea: \n
-It is an infection that mainly grows in moist and warm areas such as vagina, cervix, urethra, rectum and throat. It spreads through unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex, it can also spread through using and sharing sex toys if they are un washed after the use.
-Symptoms:\n
-In women:\n
-1)More than usual vaginal discharge of greenish yellow tinge\n
-2)Pain during urination \n
-3)Infection in rectum and in eyes \n

-2.Testicle pain and tenderness \n
-How to get rid of Gonorrhoea\n
-Before treatments tests are recommended.\n
-It is a good practice to always use protection (Condom)
-Even though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition.
-Risk Factors\n
-Number of sexual partners. The more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract a genital HPV infection. Having sex with a partner who has had multiple sex partners also increases your risk.
-Age. Common warts occur mostly in children. Genital warts occur most often in adolescents and young adults.
-Weakened immune systems. People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections. Immune systems can be weakened by HIV/AIDS or by immune system-suppressing drugs used after organ transplants.
-Complications\n:
-Oral and upper respiratory lesions. Some HPV infections cause lesions on your tongue, tonsils, soft palate, or within your larynx and nose.
-Cancer. Certain strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer. These strains might also contribute to cancers of the genitals, anus, mouth and upper respiratory tract. (Mayo Clinic, 2019)
-A regular Pap Amer Test enables in detecting the virus.
-\nIt is best advised that you consult a doctor in every step of the way.
-4)Hepatitis B\n
-Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids, including sex with an infected partner, injection-drug use that involves sharing needles, syringes, or drug-preparation equipment and needle sticks or exposures to sharp instruments. WHO estimates that in 2015, 257 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positive)? In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 887 000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (i.e., primary liver cancer). (World Health Organization , 2020)
-Symptoms\n
-Most people do not experience any symptoms when newly infected. However, some people have acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. A small subset of persons with acute hepatitis can develop acute liver failure, which can lead to death. In some people, the hepatitis B virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.[ Hepatitis B, by WHO
-https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b
-]
-Treatment:\n
-The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as three or four injections over six months. You can't get hepatitis B from the vaccine.
-Take precautions to avoid HBV
-Other ways to reduce your risk of HBV include:
-Know the HBV status of any sexual partner. Don't engage in unprotected sex unless you're absolutely certain your partner isn't infected with HBV or any other sexually transmitted infection.
-Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex if you don't know the health status of your partner. Remember that although condoms can reduce your risk of contracting HBV, they don't eliminate the risk.
-Don't use illegal drugs. If you use illicit drugs, get help to stop. If you can't stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs. Never share needles.
-Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing. If you get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop. Ask about how the equipment is cleaned. Make sure the employees use sterile needles. If you can't get answers, look for another shop.[ Mayo clinic- Hepatitis B

-6)Syphilis: \n
-Syphilis is a bacterial infection usually spread by sexual contact. The disease starts as a painless sore typically on your genitals, rectum or mouth. Syphilis spreads from person to person via skin or mucous membrane contact with these sores. After the initial infection, the syphilis bacteria can remain inactive (dormant) in your body for decades before becoming active again. Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot (injection) of penicillin. Without treatment, syphilis can severely damage your heart, brain or other organs, and can be life-threatening. Syphilis can also be passed from mothers to unborn children.[ Mayo Clinic- Syphilis

-Stage 1: Sores on vagina, penis, mouth or anus \n
-Stage 2: rashes within two- six months of infection, along with flu like symptoms \n
-Stage 3: Vital organs of the body like heart and brain are damaged permanently \n
-Visit your doctor if you experience, unusual discharge, sore or rash especially in vagina or penis.\n
-Risk factors: \n
-You face an increased risk of acquiring syphilis if you:\n
-Engage in unprotected sex\n
-Have sex with multiple partners\n
-Are a man who has sex with men\n
-Are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS\n
-Best way to prevent syphilis by using protection\n

+Getting tested also protects you by letting you know if you DO have an STD, so you can get the right treatment to stay healthy and avoid giving it to other people.
+
+Sticking to sexual activities that don’t spread STDs — like outercourse or mutual masturbation (masturbating while with each other) — is a great way to safely get sexual pleasure and be intimate with another person. But if you’re taking off underwear and touching each other, sharing sexual fluids, or having any kind of sex, using barriers is the safer way to go.
+
+If you touch your partner’s genitals with your hands, wash your hands before touching your own genitals, mouth, or eyes to avoid passing sexual fluids. If you’re sharing sex toys, make sure to wash the toys with soap and water before they touch another person’s body. You can also use condoms on sex toys — change the condom before it touches another person’s body.
+
+Another way to make sex safer is to avoid drinking too much alcohol or doing other drugs. Getting wasted can make you forget how important safer sex is, and you may accidentally make decisions that increase your chances of getting STDs. It’s also harder to use condoms correctly and remember other safer sex basics when you’re drunk or high.
+
+The only way to be totally sure you won’t get an STD is to never have any kind of sexual contact with another person. But that doesn’t work for the vast majority of people — most of us are sexually intimate with other people at some point in our lives. So if you’re going to have sex, making it safer sex is the best way to help you avoid getting or passing an STD.
