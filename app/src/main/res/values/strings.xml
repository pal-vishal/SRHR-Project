    <string name="ques1Rape">What is Rape?</string>
    <string name="ques3Rape">What are different types of Rape?</string>
    <string name="ans3Rape">Following are different types of Rape:
1)Minor Rapes
2)Gang Rapes
3)Marital Rapes
4)Incest
5)Revenge Rape
6)Custodial Rape
7)Rape under the false pretext of marriage

Minor or statutory rape
Statutory rape is a crime that involves sexual contact with a person who is under an age specified by law, commonly referred to as the “age of consent.” Most states no longer refer to this crime as statutory rape. The legal term for the crime varies from state to state and includes sexual intercourse with a minor, sexual assault of a child, criminal sexual penetration of a minor or a child under a certain age, and sexual abuse of a minor. Statutory rape is based on the notion that a person under a certain age cannot consent to sexual contact or activity because he or she lacks the maturity or judgement necessary to make a knowing choice about sexual activity. Even when no force is involved and the sex appears consensual, the act of having sex with a person under the age of consent is a crime solely because of that persons age. (Crimiminal Defence Lawyer , 2018 )[ Statutory Rape Laws and Charges published by NOLO
https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/sex-crimes/statutory-rape-charges-punishment-defense
]
Gang Rapes- IPC 376 D defines gang rape as “Where a woman is raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to committed the offence of rape” Gang Rapes are the rapes that involves a group of men, this act is pre- meditated and pre-empted. When a group of men have sexual intercourse that is non-consensual (not agreed upon), or they force another person to have sex against her will.
Marital Rapes- Intimate partner rape. A rape that is non- consensual, (not agreed upon), or if a husband or a partner (living in Domestic Relationship) forces wife or the other partner to have sex against her will it is termed as marital rape.  Rape includes intercourse in the vagina, anus, or mouth. It is unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a persons will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception. Marital rape is a non- criminalised crime in India. India is one of the thirty-six countries that still have not criminalized marital rape.
Incest- Incest is sexual intercourse between closely related persons. The crime of sexual intercourse, cohabitation, or marriage between persons within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity wherein marriage is legally forbidden. The prevalence of incest cases is reported to vary between 5% and 62% according to culture, the source of the report, and geographic location.
Revenge Rape- Payback rape", also called "revenge rape", is a form of rape specific to certain culture. It consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers. The rape is meant to humiliate and bring shame upon the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behaviour towards the perpetrators.  Payback rape is sometimes connected to tribal fighting.
Custodial Rape- Custodial rape is one of the most heinous and serious crimes against women and one of the categories of rape which involves the abuse of power and authority, by people responsible to protect and promote the rights of women. At present, the greatest threats faced by women are from those who are supposed to protect them. Police and custodial rape are the most prevalent forms of aggravated rape in India. Custodial rapes are heinous crimes as they reflect betrayal of custodial trust by a public servant against the helpless citizen.
Rape under false pretext of Marriage- Hindu marriage joins two individuals for life, so that they can pursue dharma (duty), artha (possessions), and kama (physical desires). It is a union of two individuals as husband and wife, and is recognized by law. In Hinduism, marriage is followed by traditional rituals for consummation.

The consent for sexual intercourse obtained by a person by giving false promise of marriage would not excuse him from rape charges. Whenever the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact as per Section 90 of the Indian Panel Code, and, in such a case, such a consent would not excuse the offender and such an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of the Indian Panel Code, and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.
Section 375 and Section 90 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and on the consent/consensual sex are required to be referred to and considered.
Laws pertaining to sexual assault/ harassment and rape in India
POCSO- The POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive law to provide for the protection of children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, while safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated Special Courts. The said Act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age, and defines different forms of sexual abuse, including penetrative and non-penetrative assault, as well as sexual harassment and pornography, and deems a sexual assault to be “aggravated” under certain circumstances, such as when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-à-vis the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor. People who trafficking children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the provisions relating to abetment in the said Act. The said Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life, and fine.
Sexual Harassment at Work Place- Sexual harassment at a workplace is considered violation of womens right to equality, life and liberty. It creates an insecure and hostile work environment, which discourage womens participation in work, thereby adversely affecting their social and economic empowerment and the goal of inclusive growth1. With this idea the legislature formulated the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.</string>

2)Genital Warts
It is caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), they are mainly concentrated in the pubic area, particularly the vagina, cervix, penis, anus and rectum. HPV infection occurs when the virus enters your body, usually through a cut, abrasion or small tear in your skin. The virus is transferred primarily by skin-to-skin contact. Genital HPV infections are contracted through sexual intercourse, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital region. Some HPV infections that result in oral or upper respiratory lesions are contracted through oral sex. If you are pregnant and have an HPV infection with genital warts, it is possible your baby may get the infection. Rarely, the infection may cause a noncancerous growth in the babys voice box (larynx).
Warts are contagious. They can spread through direct contact with a wart. Warts can also spread when someone touches something that already touched a wart.[ HPV infection by Mayo Clinic

How to get rid of Gonorrhoea
Before treatments tests are recommended.
It is a good practice to always use protection (Condom)
Even though we provide you with solutions, it is best advised that please visit a doctor for your condition.
Risk Factors
Number of sexual partners. The more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract a genital HPV infection. Having sex with a partner who has had multiple sex partners also increases your risk.
Age. Common warts occur mostly in children. Genital warts occur most often in adolescents and young adults.
Weakened immune systems. People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections. Immune systems can be weakened by HIV/AIDS or by immune system-suppressing drugs used after organ transplants.
Complications:
Oral and upper respiratory lesions. Some HPV infections cause lesions on your tongue, tonsils, soft palate, or within your larynx and nose.
Cancer. Certain strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer. These strains might also contribute to cancers of the genitals, anus, mouth and upper respiratory tract. (Mayo Clinic, 2019)
A regular Pap Amer Test enables in detecting the virus.
It is best advised that you consult a doctor in every step of the way.
4)Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids, including sex with an infected partner, injection-drug use that involves sharing needles, syringes, or drug-preparation equipment and needle sticks or exposures to sharp instruments. WHO estimates that in 2015, 257 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positive)? In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 887 000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (i.e., primary liver cancer). (World Health Organization , 2020)
Symptoms
Most people do not experience any symptoms when newly infected. However, some people have acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. A small subset of persons with acute hepatitis can develop acute liver failure, which can lead to death. In some people, the hepatitis B virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.[ Hepatitis B, by WHO

]
Treatment:
The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as three or four injections over six months. You can not get hepatitis B from the vaccine.
Take precautions to avoid HBV
Other ways to reduce your risk of HBV include:
Know the HBV status of any sexual partner. Do not engage in unprotected sex unless you are absolutely certain your partner is not infected with HBV or any other sexually transmitted infection.
Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex if you do not know the health status of your partner. Remember that although condoms can reduce your risk of contracting HBV, they do not eliminate the risk.
Do not use illegal drugs. If you use illicit drugs, get help to stop. If you can not stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs. Never share needles.
Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing. If you get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop. Ask about how the equipment is cleaned. Make sure the employees use sterile needles. If you can not get answers, look for another shop.[ Mayo clinic- Hepatitis B

6)Syphilis:
Syphilis is a bacterial infection usually spread by sexual contact. The disease starts as a painless sore typically on your genitals, rectum or mouth. Syphilis spreads from person to person via skin or mucous membrane contact with these sores. After the initial infection, the syphilis bacteria can remain inactive (dormant) in your body for decades before becoming active again. Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot (injection) of penicillin. Without treatment, syphilis can severely damage your heart, brain or other organs, and can be life-threatening. Syphilis can also be passed from mothers to unborn children.[ Mayo Clinic- Syphilis

The Infection spreads in 3 stages
Stage 1: Sores on vagina, penis, mouth or anus
Stage 2: rashes within two- six months of infection, along with flu like symptoms
Stage 3: Vital organs of the body like heart and brain are damaged permanently
Visit your doctor if you experience, unusual discharge, sore or rash especially in vagina or penis.
Risk factors:
You face an increased risk of acquiring syphilis if you:
Engage in unprotected sex
Have sex with multiple partners
Are a man who has sex with men
Are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS
Best way to prevent syphilis by using protection
It is best advised that you consult a doctor in every step of the way.

Your ability to get an abortion will depend on the opinion of the doctor, only then are they legally allowed to perform an abortion. An abortion without fulfilling the conditions is considered a crime.

Under the law (section 3 of The medical termination of pregnancy Act 1971), the doctor can perform an abortion in the following situations:
If the pregnancy would be harmful to your life, physical or mental health, the doctor will need to consider your circumstances to figure out if the pregnancy will harm you. They also need to look at your future (as a reasonable person would) to figure out the outcome of the pregnancy.
If there is a likely chance that the child would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities which would leave him or her seriously handicapped.
If the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks (first trimester), only one doctor needs to confirm that the conditions have been fulfilled.
If the pregnancy has exceeded 12 weeks but is below 20 weeks (first trimester), two doctors need to confirm that the conditions have been fulfilled.
The gestation period does not matter if doctor feels that an immediate abortion must be conducted to save your life.
The doctor who determines if it is necessary to perform an abortion and performs it needs to be a registered medical practitioner under the law.

This is generally known as quickening and usually takes place between 17 and 20 weeks. Both you and your doctor can be punished with jail time of up to 7 years and fine unless it was done in good faith to save your life.

A thought to ponder:

When one explores these laws, it becomes apparent that they still look at women, primarily as mothers. This position is critiqued extensively by Gauri Pillai. In essence, Pillai argues, The MTP Act allows for abortion only under exceptional circumstances, implying that by default, women should continue with the pregnancy. The Act does not provide abortion as an independent right, but basis it on the presence of certain conditions. Additionally, the Act looks at abortion through the prism of a medical procedure, (as suggested by the name of the Act itself- Medical Termination of Pregnancy) and not abortion. The Statement of Reasons and Objects of the Act describes abortion as a health measure and to prevent wastage of life. The Act gives weightage to the opinion of medical practitioners and views them as co-decison makers along with women. Womens decisions to undergo an abortion are overridden if the Medical Board opines that the continuation of pregnancy is less hazardous than termination at that stage. Thus, the medical risk of termination becomes the primary consideration while making a decision under the Act. writes Gauri Pillai.

Originally, abortion was a criminal offence for both, the woman and the abortionist, barring instances where it was necessary to save the life of the woman. To address these concerns, Shah Committee, led by Shantilal Shah was established in 1964. The goal of this committee was to suggest modifications in the abortion law. In 1966, the committee, after comprehensively studying socio-cultural, legal and medical aspects of abortion, made several recommendations to liberalise the abortion laws. Based on Shah Committees findings, The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971 came into existence. But implementation and availability of medical services required for a safe abortion is still to become a reality. Whether urban or rural demography the access to services and information becomes very difficult so the whole idea behind the MTP Act that this will liberalize abortion law in the country and make easier access is not happening.

However, when one explores these laws, it becomes apparent that they still look at women, primarily as mothers. This position is critiqued extensively by Gauri Pillai. In essence, Pillai argues, The MTP Act allows for abortion only under exceptional circumstances, implying that by default, women should continue with the pregnancy.

Thus, the medical risk of termination becomes the primary consideration while making a decision under the Act. writes Gauri Pillai.

Therefore, a close study of Indias abortion law reveals how poorly it identifies with the vision of the Constitution. Our Constitution was supposed to act as a vehicle of radical social and cultural change. This reductive spirit of the abortion laws, then, clearly does not match the transformative characteristics of the Constitution. As per the laws, the fact that women can reproduce, is understood to mean that they must. Through this, women seeking abortion are seen as any other patient is. Abortion laws must be an enabler for women to undo historical wrongs and take back control over their bodies and lives.</string>
