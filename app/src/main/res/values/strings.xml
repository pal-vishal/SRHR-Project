    <string name="puberty_content">Professor James M. Tanner, a child development expert, was the first to identify the visible stages of puberty. Today, these stages are known as the Tanner stages or, more appropriately, sexual maturity ratings. They serve as a general guide to physical development, although each person has a different puberty timetable.  Girls Puberty usually starts between ages 9 and 11. The first signs of breasts, called “buds,” start to form under the nipple. They may be itchy or tender, which is normal.  It’s common for breasts to be different sizes and grow at different rates. So, it’s normal if one bud appears larger than the other. The darker area around the nipple (areola) will also expand. In addition, the uterus begins to get larger, and small amounts of pubic hair start growing on the lips of the vagina. Girls with higher body mass index experience an earlier onset of puberty. BOYS In boys, puberty usually starts around age 11. The testicles and skin around the testicles (scrotum) begin to get bigger. Also, early stages of pubic hair forms on the base of the penis.</string>

    <string name="pcn_heading">PCPNDT (Pre-Conception Pre-natal Diagnostic Technique) Act</string>
    <string name="pcn_content"  formatted="false">The sex ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of males to number of females in a population set. It is internationally expressed per 100 females but in India, it is expressed as per 1000 males. This means that there is an imbalance between the two sexes i.e. there are less women per thousand males. According to the 2011 census, for every 1000 boys, there are only 918 girls. The child sex ratio in India has been on the decline since 1991 and the worst since independence. According to the 1991 census, there were 945 girls for every 1000 boys and in 2001,927 girls for every 1000 boys. Keeping this in mind, PCPNDT (Pre-Conception Pre-natal Diagnostic Technique) act was constituted to control or rather ban the use of technology i.e. ultra sound to determine the sex of the fetus before its birth. This Act of the Parliament of India was enacted to stop female foeticides and address the declining sex ratio in India.
